# SpaceLinkExplorer Program

This C program implements Dijkstra's algorithm to find the shortest path from Earth to other celestial objects in our solar system. It uses a matrix to represent the distances between celestial objects and provides information about each object using a struct.

## Features

- Dijkstra's algorithm implementation.
- Struct to store information about celestial objects.
- User interaction for input and jokes.
